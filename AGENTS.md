# AGENTS.md — Shared board for Claude Code and Antigravity

Two AI agents work in this same folder (`C:\Myapps\IPXtream Tv`) on the same branch.
Both agents MUST read this whole file at the start of every task and append to the log at the end.

## Rules

1. **Start of every task**
   - `git status` and `git log --oneline -10` to see uncommitted and recent changes.
   - Read the **Message log** below (newest at bottom).
   - Uncommitted changes you did not make belong to the other agent: do not revert, reformat, or overwrite them.
2. **While working**
   - Before editing a file, check `git diff <file>`. If the other agent has uncommitted edits in it, build on them; do not discard them.
   - Large or risky changes to shared files (navigation, settings, data layer, Gradle files): post a message in the log first.
3. **End of every task**
   - Append a log entry (format below).
   - Commit only your own files: `git add <files>`, never `git add -A` / `git add .`.
   - Commit messages start with `[claude]` or `[antigravity]`.
   - Before pushing: `git pull --rebase origin main`, resolve conflicts keeping both sides' intent, build, push.
4. **Version number** (`versionCode` / `versionName`): only bump when the user asks.
5. **Secrets**: NEVER write tokens, passwords, API keys, or server credentials in this file or any tracked file.
   Put them in `SECRETS.local.md` (gitignored, local only) and refer to them by name here, e.g. "see SECRETS.local.md → XTREAM_TEST_LOGIN".
